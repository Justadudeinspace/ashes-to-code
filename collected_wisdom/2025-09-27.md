## Personal Log Triad

- [Gate Keepers](../personal/2025-09-27.md#gate-keepers) → Stand against cages and gatekeepers.  
- [Adapt to Overcome](../personal/2025-09-27.md#adapt-to-overcome) → Refuse dead ends; seek workarounds.  
- [Courage](../personal/2025-09-27.md#courage) → Move through fear and doubt anyway.  

**Integration:** Defy false authority, adapt to challenges, and carry courage forward.

## Flame Walker Profile

- [Healthy Defiance](../flame_walker/flame-walker-2025-09-27.md)  
  → Gonzo journalism, rebellion, addiction’s shadow, defiance against the system, final autonomy.  

**Reflection:** Healthy defiance is not self-destruction — it is shaping your life on your own terms.

## Parallel Weaving

Each daily entry interlinks:  
- **DevLog** → technical progress.  
- **Personal Log** → internal reflection.  
- **Flame Walker** → external archetype.  
- **Collected Wisdom** → synthesis of the three.

Together, they form a lattice of progress, spirit, and defiance.
