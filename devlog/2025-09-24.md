# Ashes to Code — 2025-09-24

### Reflection (24)
I removed all the other repositories to streamline focus to the flagship (**BLUX Lite GOLD**). The vision is still there for each, but I know where my energy needs to be now.

- **BLUX-cA** — shelved, but never forgotten. This is the *Conscious Agent* I’ll circle back to when I’m ready to build a full, local-first LLM aligned to my constitution.
- **BLUX Quantum** — the future CLI + plugin fabric. It stays in the vault until the Lite orchestrator is stable enough to plug into it.
- **BLUX Commander** — planned as the operations/control layer. For now it waits; vision is clear, execution comes later.
- **Ashes to Code** — the devlog itself, more than a repo. A place for the raw story, the evolution, the record.
- **Other experiments** (TWRP tooling, side ideas) — parked, because focus is gold. When the flagship is standing strong, these side projects can breathe again.
