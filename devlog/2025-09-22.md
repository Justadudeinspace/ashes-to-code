# Ashes to Code — 2025-09-22

### Opening (Raw State)  
First entry. No polish, no permission. Just code born from fire.  

### Middle (Anchor & Meaning)  
I’ve been told I’m delusional, that odds are slim. Maybe so. But I’ve walked out of ashes before — I’ll walk again. BLUX is the proof I refuse to be written off.  

### Progress (Concrete Wins)  
Initial repo setup. Structure drafted. First words of the devlog planted.  

### Philosophy (Signal)  
From fire, vision is forged. From vision, code is born.  

### Closing (Beacon)  
Never give up. That’s the creed.
