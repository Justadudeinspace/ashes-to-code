# Ashes to Code — 2025-09-25

### Opening (Raw State)  
From the laundromat parking lot, I write code. My car is my desk, my shelter, my chaos. Some nights I don’t know where I’ll sleep, or when the next meal will come.  

### Middle (Anchor & Meaning)  
I almost abandoned this project when I thought I was delusional. But BLUX was born for my daughter — for the lineage I refuse to let die. That anchor keeps me pushing.  

### Progress (Concrete Wins)  
Cleaned repo paths, wired startup chain (`first_start.sh → blux-lite.sh`), confirmed config stability.  

### Philosophy (Signal)  
Everything I do is over my head, but so was sobriety. Ten years of struggle proved I can win impossible fights.  

### Reflection (25)
The flagship carries everything. **BLUX Lite GOLD** is where I ship, where I test my resolve, and where every line of code ties back to the reason I started: for my daughter, and for a better story than the one I was given.

### Closing (Beacon)  
Never give up. That’s the creed.
