# Poetic Mantra

I know we're wrong  
We are the same  
We are the same  
You know I'm wrong  
It's time for change  
Time for change  

The topic is logic about my chaotic biology  
I'm psychotically demonic for narcotic philosophy  
Atomic and philosophic for catastrophic prophecy  
Tonic and chronic, a psychoneurotic novelty  

I'm an addict disregarded and exiled from the whole pack  
With a strictly hard hit to get rilled and finally throwback  
Think I'm kicked and bombarded in fair style, hold back  
I'm about to lift it uncharted and then smile, now patched  

I got to get props to my God the Father in the greatest honor  
I'm talking big drops with my eye caught further than a famous scholar  
Life bearing rich crops to a soldier in the heinous hour  
Just like a quick Fox it drives hard and warfare for famous power  

I know we're wrong  
We are the same  
We are the same  
You know I'm wrong  
It's time for change  
Time for change
