## Skills Delta

| Area                   | Before (Then)                                   | Now (Today)                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Script Chains**      | Fragile, unclear flow                           | `first_start.sh → auto-start.sh → blux-lite.sh` verified; strict flags; exec bits set |
| **Python/TUI**         | Ad-hoc runs                                     | `python -m blux.tui_blg` with `__main__` guard; Legacy/TUI router confirmed |
| **Config & Paths**     | Inconsistent, easy to break                     | Standardized `.config/blux-lite-gold/` + `auto-start.json` read/write       |
| **Repo Structure**     | Scattered repos                                 | Two strong pillars: **BLUX Lite GOLD**, **Ashes to Code**                   |
| **Documentation Cadence** | Sporadic                                     | Personal / DevLog / Flame Walker / Collected Wisdom / QUOTES with cross-links |
| **Identity & Ethos**   | Unstated                                        | **Rebel_Eng, Alchemy_Writer, Consc_Coder** (GitHub pronouns & badges)      |

## 30-Day Focus (Doable Targets)

[ ] Re-verify launch chain on clean env; reapply set -euo pipefail.

[ ] Confirm .config/blux-lite-gold/ creation & auto-start.json R/W.

[ ] TUI footer: add (( • )) + rotate word-signals.

[ ] README: lock run path + cross-link ATC.

[ ] Add DevLog 2025-09-28 + indexes + Parallel Logs footers.

[ ] One small refactor/week (max 30 minutes each) to keep momentum.

## Creed

Never give up. That’s the creed.
Pace over perfection. Heart over hype.
