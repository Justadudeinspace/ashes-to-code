# Gate Keepers

I don't like cages which means I don't like Gate's meant to keep me out. If I obeyed the natural order and listened to the self-proclaimed Gate Keeper's, naysayers, and the like, I wouldn't be me. I'm not here to fall in line, I was born with a rebel spine. I'm not after anyone's acceptance or approval outside of my own, and I'm not asking for permission. If I was here to be liked then I'd have already lost the point of standing outside of conformity and a "boxed-in" mindframe.

# Adapt to Overcome

Never let the closed mind of another dictate the fate of your vision. Many might say, "It can't be done," and though this may be the case in the perception it's envisioned, never accept a dead end. When facing a roadblock, one can accept defeat or look for a workaround. Possibilities only die when you give up, and sometimes the solution just remains to be discovered.

# Courage

Courage is not the absence of doubt and fear, but it is the willingness to proceed forward through doubt and fear. To face doubt and fear head on saying, "I will proceed anyway." This is how new possibilities are formed.

## Integration

Taken together, these entries form a clear progression:
- **Gate Keepers** — defining resistance and the refusal to bow to external cages.  
- **Adapt to Overcome** — showing the mindset of resilience and creativity when resistance hardens into roadblocks.  
- **Courage** — embodying the inner engine that makes adaptation and rebellion possible.  

This triad becomes both **creed and compass**: defy false authority, adapt when confronted, and move forward with courage.
