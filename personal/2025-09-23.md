# We Do Recover
Recovery of any state in life is possible if one faces themselves in the mirror honestly and courageously.  

It begins with the willingness to see one’s own faults without excuse, and to stand unflinching in the face of them.  
Through focused awareness, the mind can be retrained, behavior rewritten, and a new code of values authored.  

Recovery is not luck — it is continuous, forced effort, day after day, until change becomes your nature.
