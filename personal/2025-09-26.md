# The Shadow

> “Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darknesses of other people.”  
> ― Carl Gustav Jung

Carl Jung said: to step into the Shadow, one must first know the darkness within.

To step into the Shadow is like approaching the horizon of a black hole — an event boundary where all light bends, and the whole of darkness becomes unavoidable.  
The Shadow needs no label; it is the essence of darkness itself.

To adventure into that gravity well and return alive is to know yourself more fully: to name what was hidden, to accept what was denied, and to emerge stronger for having faced it.

# Sun Tzu, The Art of War

> “Retreat is not always a cowardice act.”  
> — *Adapted*

Retreat can be a tactical advantage. When faced with an enemy force that outnumbers your own, retreat to the high ground for vantage points and regrouping.

# Be Water

> “Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless, like water.  
> If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.  
> You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle.  
> You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.  
> Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”  
> ― Bruce Lee 0

To “Be Water” is to yield and to strike, to adapt and to hold.  
In life’s battles—internal or external—rigidness breaks; fluidity perseveres.
