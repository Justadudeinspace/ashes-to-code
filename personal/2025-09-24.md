# Fatherhood
Fatherhood is standing firm on values that live at the very core of the self.  

It is defined not by self-righteousness, but by righteous acts.  
To lead by example, to sacrifice without complaint, to shape a path that your children can walk with pride — this is the quiet honor of a father.  

Strength is not in what you demand, but in what you give and uphold.
