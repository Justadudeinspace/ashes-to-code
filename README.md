_A living log of struggle, resilience, and code._  
**This is a therapy for me.**  
Never give up. Thatâ€™s the creed.

## About
**Ashes to Code (ATC)** is a dedicated devlog repository â€” separate from the BLUX codebase â€”
to record the truth behind the work. Itâ€™s raw on purpose and meant to heal, not harm.

- Code lives here â†’ **[BLUX Lite GOLD:](https://github.com/Justadudeinspace/blux-lite)**
- Devlogs live here â†’ **ATC** (this repo)

## ðŸ”¥ Dedication

See **[DEDICATION](DEDICATION.md)**  

This project is not for applause or support â€” it is for my daughter.  
Every log and every line of code is proof that I refused to quit.

## ðŸ“œ Quotes

Collected fragments, mentors, and signal lines from across  
**DevLogs**, **Personal Logs**, and **Flame Walker**.

## How to Add a New Entry
Use the helper script to create a dated Markdown file with the standard template:

```bash
python3 scripts/new_entry.py "YYYY-MM-DD" "Short title (optional)"
# Example:
python3 scripts/new_entry.py 2025-10-01 "Small wins, steady fire"
```

This generates `devlog/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with the 5-part template (raw â†’ anchor â†’ progress â†’ signal â†’ beacon).
